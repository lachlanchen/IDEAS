# About This Repository

IDEAS is a versioned research notebook covering optics, metasurfaces, computational physics, and wireless power (tap‑and‑charge). Each idea begins as Markdown under `ideas/` and, when mature, is mirrored to LaTeX with a compiled PDF under `publications/<slug>/`.

Highlights
- Content-first workflow: write in Markdown, publish as LaTeX/PDF.
- Slug‑based publication structure: `publications/<slug>/<slug>.tex|pdf`.
- Chinese (CJK) documents use XeLaTeX; others build with `latexmk -pdf`.
- Simple builds, clear conventions, and minimal tooling.

See `README.md` for the full index and build commands.
